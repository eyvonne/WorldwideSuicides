<h2>Data Cleaning</h2>
<p>The annual GDP was listed originally as a string with commas that needed to
  be removed and formatted as ints. The original data frame also included a
  column that had the year and country combined, which wasnâ€™t useful for the
  model so it was dropped. In addition to gender, this study made use of the
  Human Development Index (HDI). The HDI was the only feature with missing
  values. To impute these values a custom function was written that used the
  average HDI for the country. Countries without an HDI were not included,
  even if suicides were reported in those countries.

It was originally planned to use the total number of suicides as the target
vector but after building an initial model it was decided it would make more
sense to predict the suicides/100k population. This normalization took the
population from being the largest impact on the final prediction to being one
of the smallest, focusing instead on the sex and HDI.</p>
