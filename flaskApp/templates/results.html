<h2>Results</h2>

<p>The Random Forest model was able to achieve a mean absolute error of 8.13
  suicides per 100k people. This beats the mean baseline score of 13.09. Sex
  is the best predictor of suicide, and men are more likely to kill themselves
  than women. The Human Development Index is the second best suicide predictor,
  followed by age, and annual GDP. These determinations were made using a
  feature permutation model</p>

  <h2>The HDI Sruprise</h2>
<p>A somewhat surprising finding is that suicide was not negatively correlated
  with an increasing HDI. It was originally assumed that as this measure of
  wellbeing increased, that the likelihood of suicide would decline. However,
  this is not the case. The HDI is a multivariate measure that accounts for
  life expectancy, knowledge, and standard of living
  (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Development_Index). The model suggests
  that this measure, which is intended to capture the goodness of a human life,
  does not always correspond to a personâ€™s own happiness or desire to continue
  their life. Further, the particular spike at .8, suggests that there may be a
  threshold where economic and material conditions start to matter less in
  terms of overall  life satisfaction. There may be certain stress levels
  associated with this threshold, that is not experienced by people that fall
  below or above it on the index. A higher HDI does not always indicate a
  greater desire to live, even if a very high HDI does.

One thing that the HDI does not include is a measure for gender identity or
expression. Other studies
(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5178031/) have shown that gender,
queering, and other identity issues have been associated with suicide. A future
study might try to account for this factor among reported suicides.

A future study might also consider substituting the income-adjusted HDI, which
more accurately expresses economic inequality and is described in Wikipedia
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_inequality-adjusted_HDI).
