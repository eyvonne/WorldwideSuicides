<h3>Modeling</h3>
<p>
Originally an XGBoost regressor was fit to the data, but it was found that the
model would predict values of less than zero, which didnâ€™t make sense for this
dataset. By using a random forest the range on the output was limited to being
similar to that of the input, meaning that the predictions never said that a
country would experience a negative number of suicides. These two SHAP
(SHapley Additive exPlanations) plots are made using the same data, just using
the different models. The actual suicides per 100k for this data was 3.77.</p>
